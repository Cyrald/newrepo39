# Natural Products E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

This is a full-featured e-commerce platform for natural and organic products, built as a React SPA with a Node.js/Express backend. The application serves customers shopping for natural products while providing comprehensive admin tools for product management, order processing, and customer support.

The platform implements a role-based access control system supporting administrators, marketers, consultants, and customers. It integrates with third-party services for payments (YooKassa), delivery (CDEK, Boxberry), and email verification.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Routing:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- Single Page Application (SPA) architecture

**UI & Styling:**
- Shadcn UI component library for consistent design system
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Custom color palette: green (primary), beige, and gold accents
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Typography: Open Sans (body), Playfair Display/Lora (serif headings)

**State Management:**
- Zustand for global application state
- TanStack Query (React Query v5) for server state management and caching

- Consistent spacing using Tailwind units (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24)

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Node.js with Express.js
- TypeScript for type safety across the stack
- RESTful API endpoints under `/api` prefix

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with middleware
- Token verification middleware (`authenticateToken`)
- Role requirement middleware (`requireRole`)

**File Upload:**
- Multer middleware for handling multipart/form-data
- Separate storage for product images and chat attachments
- File type validation (JPEG, PNG, WEBP only)
- Files stored in local `/uploads` directory

**Real-time Communication:**
- WebSocket server (ws library) for live support chat
- Token-based WebSocket authentication
- Mounted on `/ws` endpoint

### Data Storage Solutions

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL as the primary database
- Neon serverless PostgreSQL for cloud deployment
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries and migrations

**Schema Design:**
- Users table with verification tokens and bonus balance

- Cart, wishlist, and comparison tables for user preferences
- Support messages with file attachments
- Payment cards and addresses for user convenience

**Key Features:**
- UUID primary keys for all tables
- Timestamps for created/updated tracking
- Soft delete patterns where applicable

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Flow:**
- Email/password registration with email verification
- Verification tokens with expiration
- JWT tokens (7-day expiration) stored client-side
- Nodemailer for sending verification emails

**Authorization Roles:**
1. **Customer** - Default role for registered users
2. **Consultant** - Access to support chat only
3. **Marketer** - Product, category, promotion management
4. **Admin** - Full system access including user management

**Role Flexibility:**
- Users can have multiple concurrent roles

### Business Logic

**Bonus System:**
- New users receive 100 bonus points on registration
- Cashback rates: 3% (<1000₽), 5% (<2500₽), 7% (<10000₽), 10% (≥10000₽)
- Bonuses cannot be earned when using promocodes or existing bonuses
- Maximum 20% of order can be paid with bonuses

**Promocode System:**
- Percentage-based discounts
- Minimum/maximum order amount restrictions
- Expiration dates
- Usage limits per user
- Active/inactive status toggle
- Uppercase code normalization

**Order Processing:**
- Multi-step checkout: address → delivery → payment → confirmation
- Integration with delivery services for cost calculation
- Support for multiple payment methods
- Order status tracking (pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered, cancelled)

### Performance Optimization: Database Query Optimization (November 16, 2025)

**Critical Bug Fixes Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed N+1 query problem in all product-related endpoints
- ✅ Implemented batch queries for product images using `inArray()`
- ✅ Added decimal field normalization (price, rating, dimensions) in all endpoints
- ✅ Fixed catalog page: added `onAddToCart` and `onAddToWishlist` handlers to ProductCard
- ✅ Optimized database methods to use 2-3 queries instead of 1+N queries

**Affected Methods:**
1. `getProducts()` - Batch loads all product images in single query
2. `getCartItems()` - Batch loads images with decimal normalization
3. `getWishlistItems()` - Deduplicated IDs + batch queries + decimal normalization
4. `getComparisonItems()` - Deduplicated IDs + batch queries + decimal normalization

**Performance Impact:**
- **Before:** 1 + N queries (1 for products + 1 per product for images)
- **After:** 2-3 queries total (products + all images + categories if needed)
- **Example:** Catalog with 30 products: 31 queries → 3 queries (10x improvement)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used `inArray()` from Drizzle ORM for batch loading
- Created image lookup maps (`imagesByProductId`) for O(1) access
- Added `Array.from(new Set(...))` for ID deduplication
- Normalized all decimal fields (price, discountPercentage, rating, etc.) to strings
- Maintained consistent API contract across all endpoints

**Frontend Fixes:**
- `catalog-page.tsx`: Added missing `handleAddToCart` and `handleAddToWishlist` props to ProductCard
- Proper error handling with toast notifications for cart/wishlist operations
- Stock quantity validation before adding to cart

**Architecture Review:** All changes passed architect review - no N+1 problems, proper serialization, production-ready code.

### Phase 1: Basic Frontend-Backend Integration (November 15, 2025) ✅

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive API client layer (`client/src/lib/api.ts`) with typed request functions for all endpoints
- ✅ Implemented Zustand stores for global state:
  - `authStore.ts` - User authentication state, token management, login/logout
  - `cartStore.ts` - Shopping cart state with safe total calculations
- ✅ Created React Query hooks for server state management:
  - `useAuth.ts` - Authentication queries and mutations
  - `useCategories.ts` - Category data fetching
  - `useProducts.ts` - Product listing with filters and search
  - `useCart.ts` - Cart operations with authentication guards
- ✅ Integrated authentication pages with real API:
  - Login page with email/password validation
  - Registration page with form validation
  - Email verification page with token handling
- ✅ Integrated main user-facing pages with data fetching:
  - Home page with featured products and categories
  - Catalog page with filtering and search
  - Product detail page with add-to-cart
  - Cart page with quantity updates and totals
- ✅ Created `CartItemWithProduct` DTO type for proper cart data structure
- ✅ Backend enhancement: `getCartItems()` returns product data via JOIN with decimal normalization
- ✅ Frontend safety: Cart calculations handle null products, invalid prices, NaN values
- ✅ TypeScript type safety: Full end-to-end type checking between server and client
- ✅ Development workflow running successfully on port 5000

**Technical Achievements:**
- Type-safe API layer with proper error handling (ApiError class)
- Server/client data contract with CartItemWithProduct DTO
- Decimal field normalization (PostgreSQL decimal → string → number parsing)
- Authentication guards preventing queries when logged out
- Safe cart totals with null/NaN/negative price handling
- Auto-clearing cart on authentication errors

**Design Decisions:**
- Zustand for global UI state (lightweight, simple API)
- React Query for server state (caching, auto-refetch, optimistic updates)
- Shadcn UI components for consistent design system
- Form validation with React Hook Form + Zod
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage with auto-logout on 401

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: Advanced Features & User Experience
  - Protected routes component for authenticated pages
  - Header integration with real user data and cart count
  - Checkout flow (delivery selection, payment integration)
  - Admin panel pages (product management, order processing)
  - Support chat UI with WebSocket integration
- Phase 3: Polish & Production Readiness
  - Error boundaries and loading states
  - Responsive design improvements
  - Performance optimization
  - Integration tests
  - Deployment configuration
